# frontend-nanodegree-resume
### What is this?

This a project for Udacity Front-end Nanodegree. It is a simple resume (obviously I made up some of the working experiences). You can try this live demo [Hongyu's Resume](https://iamzhaihy.github.io/udacity-fend-resume/)



### How to run it?

All you need is to do is:

1. Uncompress the zip file
2. Locate the *index.html* file
3. Right click and open it with your favorite browser.
   (Or you can just drag it to a running browser)




### Notice

1. All the things you need is in the compressed file. If the file was damaged or corrupted, you can find a copy on my Github.
2. I will add more features to this game after I learn more about JavaScript.
